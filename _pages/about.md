# Khalid Durani
Khaid Durani is a PhD researcher in Information Systems whose work examines how emerging technologies intersect with ethics, human values, and digital infrastructures. His research centers on three interrelated dimensions: **Ethics and Power** (how technologies embed and redistribute societal values, risks, and power structures), **Platforms and Media** (the role of visual discourse on social media during conflict and the governance of digital platforms), and **Responsible Innovation** (ethical design in IS development, blockchain in virtual environments, and the integration of AI in innovation teams). Methodologically, his work draws on critical, qualitative, and computational approaches to interrogate how digital technologies mediate trust, risk perceptions, and collective action.  

He has presented his research at leading international venues including **ICIS, ECIS, HICSS, and PACIS**, and published in top journals such as the **Information Systems Journal** and the **Journal of the Association for Information Systems**. His overarching aim is to develop frameworks for understanding—and shaping—the ethical and societal implications of digital technologies in an era of rapid innovation and global uncertainty.  

More specifically, his research interests span:  

- **Ethics and power in socio-technical systems**, including how technologies shape values, risk perceptions, and governance structures  
- **Visual discourses on social media**, particularly during times of conflict and crisis  
- **Blockchain applications in virtual worlds**, exploring trust, community, and accountability  
- **Ethical design in IS development**, bridging responsible innovation with practice  
- **Artificial intelligence in innovation teams**, examining collaboration, creativity, and human-AI dynamics  
- **Critical and interpretive approaches to IS research**, integrating qualitative, computational, and discourse-analytic methods
